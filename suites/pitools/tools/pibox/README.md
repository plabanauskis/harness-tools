`pibox` launches the exact host Pi installation as the host user inside a sysbox-backed Docker container. Pi [runs tools with all permissions by default](https://pi.dev); no approval-bypass or sandbox-bypass option exists or is added. The whole Pi process, including built-in tools, user `!` commands, and extension tools, executes inside the external container boundary.

The mounted project is real and writable. Run pibox from a Git repository whenever possible: Git history is the practical undo path. Outside a repository, pibox warns that edits and deletions have no Git undo and requires confirmation.

> Linux host and amd64 are required. The design is adapted from [RchGrav/claudebox](https://github.com/RchGrav/claudebox) (MIT) and follows Pi's documented whole-process [plain Docker pattern](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md), with sysbox and a richer development image added.

## Security model

The intended blast radius is narrow but real: Pi can fully change the mounted project, all host Pi state under `$HOME/.pi`, dependency caches, and per-project inner-Docker data.

- Docker runs with `--runtime=sysbox-runc`. Sysbox user-namespace isolation is the intended security boundary.
- The selected project and the complete `$HOME/.pi` directory are mounted read-write at path-identical locations. This preserves core agent state plus package-owned sibling directories such as `~/.pi/context-mode`, including directories created by packages installed later.
- A custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` outside `$HOME/.pi` receives its own read-write path-identical mount. A custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` is mounted separately only when it is outside both `$HOME/.pi` and agent state.
- The resolved host Pi installation is mounted read-only. Supported layouts are the current `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` npm package and an official compiled Pi directory with adjacent runtime assets.
- The host Docker socket is never mounted, and pibox does not use privileged mode or host networking. Docker available inside the box is an isolated inner daemon with project-specific storage.
- Host SSH and GitHub CLI credentials are not mounted. A read-only `.gitconfig` provides commit identity but no push credential.
- Provider credentials in Pi's mounted `auth.json` can be refreshed in place. pibox also forwards only an explicit allowlist of supported provider environment variables; it never forwards the entire host environment.
- There is no network-egress firewall or kernel-escape protection. Treat the project and Pi state as intentionally writable, review the boundary, and use pibox only where that tradeoff is acceptable.

Mounting the complete host `$HOME/.pi` exposes authentication, settings, packages, sessions, extension code, package-specific databases, caches, and any future state stored there. Extensions run with the same in-box authority as Pi. This broad writable mount is intentional: it preserves the complete host Pi environment rather than maintaining an allowlist that becomes incomplete as packages add state directories. Setting `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` elsewhere does not remove `$HOME/.pi` from the boundary.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker:** `docker --version` works without sudo, and `docker info -f '{{.Runtimes}}'` lists `sysbox-runc`.
2. **sysbox:** install and configure sysbox-ce for Docker. No fallback runtime is accepted.
3. **Host Pi:** `pi` is on `PATH` and comes from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` or an official compiled directory. pibox mounts this installation instead of baking in a second version.
4. **Pi state:** run Pi on the host so `${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-$HOME/.pi/agent}` exists. pibox creates `$HOME/.pi` as the host user if needed, mounts it completely, and also mounts configured custom agent or session directories when they live outside it.
5. **Authentication:** use `/login` in host Pi so `auth.json` contains provider state, or export a supported provider credential. `pibox doctor` reports an empty auth configuration, but launch does not gate on one auth method because Pi also supports local/custom providers.

## Build and install

```bash
pitools enable pibox
pibox doctor
pibox build
```

The image defaults to `pibox:latest` and is built locally for the current username, UID, GID, and home path. Set `PIBOX_IMAGE` to another image name or `PIBOX_SHARE_DIR` to a directory containing the pibox `Dockerfile`.

The image includes Node 24, Python 3 + `uv`, Go 1.26.x, Rust stable, .NET 10, GitHub CLI, Git, jq, ripgrep, fd, OpenSSL, socat, and inner Docker + Compose. Pi itself is deliberately not baked in.

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
pibox                                  # Pi in the sysbox container
pibox --model anthropic/claude-sonnet  # pass Pi arguments unchanged
pibox --no-extensions                  # any Pi CLI option works
pibox doctor
pibox version
```

The first word `build`, `doctor`, `uninstall`, `help`, or `version` is a pibox subcommand. Any other arguments pass to Pi unchanged. `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` is set in-box because the host-mounted Pi installation is the version source.

### Provider environment

Mounted `auth.json` is preferred. When environment credentials are used, pibox forwards an explicit list covering Pi's built-in Anthropic, OpenAI/Azure, Google, Bedrock, OpenRouter, Cloudflare, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, xAI, DeepSeek, NVIDIA, ZAI, Qwen, MiniMax, Xiaomi, Kimi, and other supported providers, plus proxy variables. Unrelated environment variables and credential directories such as `~/.aws` are not forwarded.

### Ports, caches, and inner Docker

The default host-to-box port range is `3000-3010`. Add ports with `PIBOX_PORTS` (space-separated), or create `<repo>/.pibox/ports` with one port or range per line:

```bash
PIBOX_PORTS="8080 5173" pibox
```

Services must listen on `0.0.0.0` in the box. The box starts its inner Docker daemon unless `PIBOX_NO_DOCKER=1` is set. Shared dependency caches are `pibox-npm`, `pibox-cargo`, `pibox-go`, `pibox-uv`, and `pibox-nuget`; inner Docker data uses `pibox-docker-<project>`.

For a visual reminder, pibox tints the terminal background. Configure `PIBOX_TINT` or disable it with `PIBOX_NO_TINT=1`. The container receives `PIBOX=1` and `PIBOX_VERSION`.

## Uninstall

```bash
pibox uninstall        # image and shared caches; asks before project data volumes
pitools disable pibox  # remove the command link
```

Run `pibox uninstall` before `pitools uninstall`. Project-specific data volumes are deleted only after explicit confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `sysbox runtime not found` | Install/configure sysbox-ce and verify Docker lists `sysbox-runc`. |
| Host Pi layout is unsupported | Install the current `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` package or use an official compiled Pi directory. |
| Agent state is missing | Run `pi` on the host first, or set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to an existing directory. |
| Custom session directory is missing | Create `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` before launching. |
| `doctor` reports auth missing | Use `/login` in host Pi or export a supported provider credential. |
| Image is missing | Run `pibox build`, or accept the interactive build prompt. |
| Inner Docker is initially unavailable | Wait until `docker info` succeeds, or use `PIBOX_NO_DOCKER=1`. |
| Browser cannot reach a service | Bind it to `0.0.0.0` and publish the port with `PIBOX_PORTS` or `.pibox/ports`. |
| Non-Git warning appears | Continue only after accepting the lack of Git undo, or use a repository. |
